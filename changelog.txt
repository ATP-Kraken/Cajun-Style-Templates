- Frame Updates -
- Added the MH2 Sketch Frame, thanks to Moth's images.
- Updated the PUMA effect to a better image that more resembles the current usage, thanks to Cardists images and code. PUMA can now be combined with the Mutate and Season frames.
- Mainframe Planeswalkers now supports Adventurer Planeswalkers.

- New Features -
- Changes the loyalty symbols to the outline effect as seen on Headmaster Urza and Carth the Lion. Changes their codes to +N, -N, and =N.
- Added Iseult's foretell watermark
- Adds Custom Watermark A, a custom watermark that takes a link from the Style tab, good for sets that use A25 style watermarks.
- Adds Alt Rarity to Mainframe templates. This can be used to change the rarity coloration and border to custom settings for a card.
- Mainframe DFC's backface card code is now editable on its own instead of being a scripted copy of the front face's.
- Added the "Remove card codes" set option. When enabled, it removes card codes like "CW01" from every card name in the set. The exact match is currently /^[CURMSL][WUBRGMZACL][0-9]+ ?[-â€”]? ?/ 
- The CARDNAME atom doesn't display those card codes in rules text.
- Updated to MID keywords.
- Added a new keyword function "this_or_that". Using this_or_that("creature") and this_or_that("permanent") will return "this creature" or "that creature" (or permanent) depending on the card's type. Passing "upper: true" as an additional argument will capitalize This or That.
- Added an experimental keyword system for DFCs, see below.

- Bug Fixes -
- Fixes a bug where the Copyright box would sometimes move as though the Vorthos Box was enabled when it wasn't.
- Fixes a bug where d20 dividers weren't visible on clear frames.
- Fixes a bug where Custom masks on Planeswalkers stopped working. Note that new masks need to be 375x523px because of layering change to the template with MSE 2.1.2.
- The PUMA mask is no longer applied to custom legend crowns to fix this https://magicseteditor.boards.net/post/37535/thread.

- Face Code -
- Keyword code is hardcoded to use the font-face values of cards, and doesn't have a way to support using the back face instead. I've made a workaround to this.
- Face Codes are strings in keyword code formatted as face_<code>_end such as face_iscreature_end.
- Face Codes will then be replaced by code that uses the proper card face's data. Face Code currently accepts the following codes
 - if_<code>_then_<string with spaces>_else_<string with spaces>
 - isartifact
 - iscreature
 - isenchantment
 - island
 - isspell
 - istarget
 - field_contains_query with spaces
 - field_notcontains_query with spaces
 
- Currently this only accepts one level and "if X then Y else Z" formats. For example, to have special text if a creature is an Elf, the code is
face_if_type_contains_Elf_then_This card is an Elf._else_This card is not an Elf._end

- This system is incredibly niche so I think this is fine for now, but if there's other functions you want mixed in here let me know and we can probably make it happen.
